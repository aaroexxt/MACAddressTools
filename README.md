# MACAddressTools
 Some basic tools I created while at COSMOS to allow on-the-fly modification of my MAC address for testing. Only works on OSX computers.

nonrandom.sh allows setting a specific MAC address. random.sh does the same but autogenerates a new MAC address. Usage: ```sudo bash random.sh```
